# terminal-velocity
This program allows for easier typing in the command prompt for Unix systems (such as the MBP). We can type certain commands in English into the terminal and the program will convert it and turn it into proper functions.

To get started, simply just run the `permissions.sh` file in your terminal by navigating to the working directory where you have downloaded/moved Terminal Velocity. This will prompt you to just give the path to wherever Terminal Velocity is on your computer.

After this script is run, you are all set up! Now, you can open up any terminal instance, just type in `TV`, and Terminal Velocity should be up and running!

Right now, this project is still very barebones, with only 6 commands, but this will definitely expand as I find more shortcuts to account for.

This README will also become more detailed as I add more commands.
